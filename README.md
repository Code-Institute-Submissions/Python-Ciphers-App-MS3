# Python-Ciphers-App-MS3

This full-stack website represents the third milestone project I designed at Code Institute Full Stack Development course, specifically the Data Centric Development module.
The main focus of this project was to have a website that allows my registered users to manage a common dataset about the chosen topic, respectively cryptography techniques using Python code. 

## The Goal of This Website
The idea behind this work is to spark curiosity in learning about the history of cryptography and how we can write simple python code to encrypt messages. 

This website is carved into the following sections:
- Home page. It shows what the website has to offer; an intro to cryptography and cipher pages with correspondent python code snippets, a page where the users can add different ciphers, the Hackathon community page and a form with which a user can send me an email for inquiries and overall collaboration. A cryptography website home page won't be complete without the Matrix rain therefore here it is emerging in front of our very eyes.
- Login/Registration page. Allow users to sign in or sign up. 
- Cipher pages. The users can navigate through different cipher pages where, for the most part, the following pieces of information will be presented: 
    - An introduction about the specific cipher
    - Python code for encryption
    - The outcome of passing a message within the cipher program, basically the encrypted message
    - Python Code for decryption
- Add Your Python Cipher page. The users will have the ability to add/write in a dedicated page their own Python cipher code. Only the author of the cipher can edit or delete the added cipher whereas every cipher information can be freely viewed from any user account.
- Hackathon community. The users will have the ability to join Hackathon community in order to actively contribute and make better our existent ciphers code or simply share cool ideas and suggestions that could lead to improving our code snippets. A user can edit and delete only their own posts whereas every other post can be freely viewed from any user account.

## UX
### User Stories
- As a user, I would like to read interesting material about cryptography in general and python application code examples in particular.

- As a user, I would like to login to an existent account.
- As a user, I would like to logout of my account.
- As a user, I would like to see on the home page what the website has to offer in terms of topics covered.
- As a user, I would like to have the possibility of adding new python ciphers in order to contribute at overall knowledge extension. 
- As a user, I would like to edit or delete my ciphers.
- As a user, I would like to be part of a community and share ideas or discvover bugs about our existent ciphers or simply speak up about interesting cryptography related news or trends.
- As a user, I would like to edit or delete my community created posts.
- As a user, I would like to contact the creator of the website for questions about the content overall, clarification where needed of code examples, report bugs discovered.
